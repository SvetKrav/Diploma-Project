## What is Google Docs?    

Google Docs is a free online word processor. With Google Docs, you can create and edit text documents in your web browser — no special software is required. Documents are auto-saved to your Google account. Files can be downloaded in a variety of formats. Many people can work at the same time, you can see people’s changes as they make them, and every change is saved automatically.   

In addition to the Google Docs web-based application, there's a mobile app available for both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-docs/id842842640) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.docs&hl=en&pli=1).
